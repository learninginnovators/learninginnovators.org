To manage students in a group, first you need to ensure your unit has group sets setup. A group set is a definition of the types of groups you can have in a unit. To setup a group set:

1. Select _New Group Set_.

   You will now see a new group created in the Group Set list, select the edit button to edit the following options:

   - **Name:** The name of the group set, by default this is "Group Work"
   - **Create Groups:** Who has permissions to create new groups in the group set, staff, or staff and students.
   - **Manage Groups:** Who has permissions to manage groups in the group set, staff, or staff and students.
   - **Restrict to Tutorials:** if true, only students from the same tutorial can be in a group.

2. Select _save_ then select the group set in the group sets list to view more information:

   - Create a group of students in the group set, by typing a group name, and selecting _Create Group_:
