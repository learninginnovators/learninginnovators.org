You need to create a group set for each different type of group work that you will have in the unit.

Inside each group set you can then add the different student groups. If you set a task to be related to a group set, then there is one submission per student group and students cannot submit if they are not in a group.


### Creating group sets

1. First select the green icon labeled "+ New Group Set":

   Under **Name** Write the name of the group set, by default this is called "Group Work" but you can change this name.
   
   Under **Create Groups** Choose who will be able to create new groups in the group work set. The drop down menu allows you to select either staff only or staff and students.
   
   Under **Manage Groups** Choose who will be able to manage student groups in this group work set. The drop down menu allows you to select either staff only or staff and students. 
   
   Under **Restrict to Tutorials** Choose who will be able to form groups. The drop down menu allows you to select either same tutorial or any tutorial.
 
3. Save!
