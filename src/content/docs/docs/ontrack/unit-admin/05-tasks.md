Under "Tasks" you will be able to add your tasks following these steps:

Click on the blue "Add Task" icon and you will get the spaces to fill in the information your task:

#### NOTE:

You can also export and import CSV files for batch task creation. To view the correct format of the CSV file for import, you can export the CSV by selecting Download CSV. You can then upload all the task descriptions and resources in a zip. file.

### 1. Task details

Choose the task achievement level aligned to this task: Pass, Credit, Distinction or High Distinction. (In the non recommended case where you want to be able to grade a task, you can choose this option under (8) Optional settings.)

Label the task with an abbreviation that includes week, sequence and grade eg. 1.1P

You can choose to assign a weight to the task based on the effort that it takes as compared to other tasks. This is only to provide students' an indication of the time/effort it takes, it does not affect anything else.

Choose a descriptive name for the task, eg. Module review 1.

Add a task description.

### 2. Inbox

Here you assign which tutorial stream will be used as the marking one. 

#### NOTE: If you have assigned tutors to tutorials and tutorials to students but your tutors can't see any students this is what is missing! Ensure the tutorial stream assigned to marking is the right one.


### 3. Due dates

Students have access to the unit's OnTrack site from the moment their email is added to it. But the timelines for submitting each specific task are set here.

1. From start date to suggested completion date: students can submit an assignment for feedback. 

Students see the dates in this format, with suggested completion date expressed as due date:

<img width="543" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-24 at 10 32 57 am" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f11e847-e17a-417d-bb55-0ca0de58e457" />


2. Between suggested completion date and deadline: students can submit their assignment but will get an automatic "time limit exceeded". Tutors can choose not to provide feedback from this point.

If students submit their work at this point, this is the message they receive:

<img width="875" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-24 at 10 34 18 am" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3117fc35-e8a3-4b5d-8835-d9095e7771a7" />


3. Deadline: once the deadline time is hit, students will not be able to submit this task anymore. They will have to include it directly in their portfolio at the end of the teaching period. 


### 4. Upload requirements

For students to be able to upload their submission for a task, you need to specify what type of file they need to submit and what they need to name the file. 

There are three types of files students can submit:

### 1. image -  ANDREW fill this please

2. document - pdf only

Turnitin can be set for checking document similarity in document submissions as can be observed in the image below. 

3. code - C, C#, C++ or python

Moss can be used to check similarity in code submissions as can be observed in the image below.

### 5. Task description and resources

<img width="857" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-24 at 11 32 52 am" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe177f45-d751-4cc2-a7d1-ce63b1109d02" />

Before uploading your documents save the task by selecting the blue symbol on the bottom right of the page. If you don't do this you might not be able to upload the documents.

Here you will upload the pdf with the task description and any other resources students need to complete the task eg. templates.

For task description you can only upload one single pdf.

In resources you can upload multiple documents, images and code compressed in a zip. file. Even if you only have one document to upload as resources you need to compress it into a zip file before uploading it. 

### 6. Task assessment automation

#### ANDREW fill this please

### 7. SCORM test

#### ANDREW fill this please

### 8. Optional settings

Here you can choose two thing:

1. Restricting students resubmissions. If you choose this, students can't resubmit the task even if asked to fix it.

2. Make this a graded task (choose a weight out of 100). Although we do not recommend having graded tasks, you can choose to have one or more tasks be graded tasks using this option.
