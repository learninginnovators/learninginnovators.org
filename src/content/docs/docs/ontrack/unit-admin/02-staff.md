To add staff into the unit start typing the name of the staff in the bottom space and when the right name comes up click on the icon "Add Staff".

If the name of the staff you need to add does not come up in the drop-down list when typing, ask them to go to the OnTrack website. That will bring them into the list.

The default access after you have one convenor is "Tutor"

If you want someone to be able to make changes and access all the information in this unit choose "Convenor" role. 

Assign the Unit chair to the main convenor role by selecting the respective box.

If you can't change someone's role to convenor it is because they don't have that level of access. Ask an administrator in your Learning Innovations team to provide that level of access to that staff member if required.

You can delete staff at any point, except whoever is labelled as main convenor. If you want to delete that staff member from the list you first need to pass the main convenor role to another convenor.
