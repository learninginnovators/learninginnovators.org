There are two ways in which you can access the admin side of a unit.

### From the dashboard

In your dashboard, you will see all the units that you teach into.

To make changes to one of your units, if you have convenor level permission in that unit, you need to first click on the unit you want to make changes in and select Administration from the dropdown.

Now you can make changes to the unit, choose the appropriate tab depending on the changes you want to make, eg. Students tab.

### From manage units 

On the top right hand corner there is a badge icon. If you select this icon you will get a drop down menu - depending on your user level you will see different options in this drop down.

If you select "Manage Units" you will get a list of the units you teach.
