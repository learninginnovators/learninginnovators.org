#### Code
Under "Code" the unit code assigned by the University is required. If more than a unit should share an OnTrack site, both codes should be included in this space using the following sample format: "DKN000/DKN999".

<!-- TODO: I think this should move to the student tab -->

For a teaching period, in Week 0, when OnTrack connects with other university systems, students enrolled in the unit will be automatically enrolled into the unit in OnTrack through this code. From then on, every night, student enrolments will be updated, so any changes in student enrolments will be reflected in OnTrack.

For a custom period, you will need to manually enrol students. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the "Students" section of this guide.

If you would like to enrol students before the system does it automatically (on the second day of week 0), or un-enrol students (for example when a unit code is incorrectly added and the wrong students have been automatically enrolled), this can be done through the "Students" tab. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the "Students" section of this guide.

Note that the sync will enrol or withdraw students who have enrolled or withdrawn - so it wont remove other students you add.


#### Name

Under "Name" the name of the unit is required.

#### Description

Under "Description" you can add the description of the unit.

#### Teaching Period

Under "Teaching Period" you can choose the trimester or teaching period the unit is running in. 

The teaching period is created by the adminsitrator of the system, if you cannot find the appropriate one from the drop down menu, or the dates are incorrect, please contact your Learning Innovation team. 

#### Draft Learning Summary

At the end of the teaching period, a student must submit their portfolio together with a "Learning Summary". If the learning summary is included as a task in your unit, you can choose it from the drop down menu here to indicate this.

#### Start Date and End date

If your unit is not running on a regular teaching period, or you do not want students to be automatically enrolled, you can choose a custom starting and end date.

These dates reflect only when the unit will be available for enrolled students to submit tasks. Units are permanently visible to students as long as they have the associated email, regardless of start or end date.

#### Portfolio Auto-Generation Date

Students are commonly instructed to submit their portfolio with a "Learning Summary" when completing the unit. It is the portfolio that gets graded so if a student does not submit their portfolio they might not get a grade. If you want all portfolios to be created automatically, so they can be graded, even if a student forgets to submit it, you can activate this auto-generated feature.

#### Allow Student Extensions

#### Extension Duration on Resubmit

#### Auto Apply Extensions

#### Allow students to Change Tutorial

Selecting this feature will allow students to change tutorials at any time.

#### Send Notification Emails

#### Synchronise Enrolments

Selecting this feature will allow the system to automatically enrol students from Callista, starting on day 2 week 0. This information is refreshed every day at midnight, so new enrolments and withdrawn students will be updated automatically.

#### Synchronise Timetable

Selecting this feature will allow OnTrack to automatically create any workshops or classes associated with the unit, and enrol students accordingly. You can find and delete or change this information under "Tutorials".

#### Overseer Assessment

#### Docker Image Name

#### Active

If you unselect this option, students and tutors will not see the unit in their OnTrack dashboard, even if enrolled.

A unit in OnTrack will be visible to students as soon as they are enrolled in it. To confirm who is enrolled go to "Students" tab. The system automatically enrols students from Callista, starting on day 2 week 0.

A unit in OnTrack will be visible to tutors the moment you add them under the "Staff" tab.
