Students will be automatically enrolled on day 2 of week 0 by OnTrack syncing with Calista.

This syncing will occur daily, updating any new enrollments or discontinuing students.

Once students are enrolled they have access to OnTrack. They keep this access for as long as they maintain their email so they will have visibility of a unit throughout their degree.

### Enrolling students manually 

If you want to enroll or unenroll students directly, you can do this through a csv. To get the csv for updating, click on "Download" at the bottom of the page. This is an example of an empty csv:

You can fill this up manually, adding or removing students, as long as you have all their required information.

### Assigning students to tutorials

There are two ways of assigning students to tutorials.

1. #### In OnTrack

You can enroll students in a tutorial by choosing the tutorial from the drop down under the student's information as shown in the picture. In this Unit we created the tutorial stream "Assessment" and the tutorial Abbreviation "P1", in other units there might be more tutorial streams and tutorials. They will all come up in the drop down menu.

3. #### Through the csv

In the csv you can see that column "I" is labelled "Assessment", this column refers to the tutorial stream we created in the "Tutorials" tab and named Assessment.

In this spreadsheet you can assign the specific tutorial under this tutorial stream that should be marking this students work.

Use the Abbreviation of that tutorial to assign a student to it, in our example the Abbreviation was P1.
