### I can't find a staff member in the list

If the name of the staff you need to add does not come up in the drop-down list when typing, ask them to go to the OnTrack website. That will bring them into the list. For more information on this check the "Staff" page.

### I created tutorials and assigned students but they don't appear in my tutors inbox

Ensure the tutorial stream assigned to marking the task is the right one. To do this go to the "Tasks" tab, choose the assessment task and under (2) "Inbox" ensure this task is assigned to the right tutorial stream. More information on this under the "Tasks" page.

### Students can't submit a task

The most common causes for thi are:

1. Upload requiremenst: For students to be able to upload their submission for a task, you need to specify the number and type of files they need to submit. For each file, you specify the name of the file and the type of file that needs to be uploaded.

2. Deadline exceeded: Once the deadline time is hit, students will not be able to submit this task anymore. They will have to include it directly in their portfolio at the end of the teaching period.
   
You can find more information about these in the "Tasks" page.

### Students are getting time exceeded while resubmitting after "fix and resubmit"

Between suggested completion date and deadline: students can submit their assignment but will get an automatic “time limit exceeded”. Tutors can choose not to provide feedback from this point.

To address this you can go the the "Unit details" tab in your unit and activate the "Extension Duration on Resubmit" option. This will set the number of weeks extensions added to a task when it is placed in the “Fix and Resubmit” status. This will be applied each time the task is assessed as needing to be fixed, but will only extend the time to the task’s deadline.

You can find more information on this on the "Unit Details" page.
