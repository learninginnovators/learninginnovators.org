## Unit details

This image shows all the information required in the unit details tab of an OnTrack unit. We will describe each area in detail in this page.

#### Code
Under "Code" the unit code assigned by the University is required. If more than a unit should share an OnTrack site, both codes should be included in this space using the following sample format: "DKN000/DKN999".

For a teaching period, in Week O, when OnTrack connects with other university systems, students enrolled in the unit will be automatically enrolled into the unit in OnTrack through this code. From then on, every night, student enrollments will be updated so any changes in student enrolments will be reflected in OnTrack.

For a custom period, 
### Andrew please add what happens for custom periods

If you would like to enrol students before the system does it automatically, or unenrol students, for example when a unit code is incorrectly added and the wrong students have been automatically enroled, this can be done through the "Students" tab. Instructions on how to do this can be found in that section of this guide.

### Andrew If the cvs is updated will the system override this when it syncs with the system again?

#### Name

Under "Name" the name of the unit is required.

#### Description

Under "Description" you can add the description of the unit.

#### Teaching Period

Under "Teaching Period" you can choose the trimester or teaching period the unit is running in. 

The teaching period is created by the adminsitrator of the system, if you cannot find the appropriate one from the drop down menu, or the dates are incorrect, please contact the Learning Innovation team. 

#### Draft Learning Summary

At the end of the teaching period, a student must submit their portfolio together with a "Learning Summary". If the learning summary is included as a task in your unit, you can choose it from the drop down menu here to indicate this.

#### Start Date and End date

### Andrew is this correct? If your unit is not running on a regular teaching period, or you do not want students to be automatically enroled, you can choose a custom starting and end date. 

### These dates reflect only when the unit will be available for enroled students to submit tasks. Units are permanently visible to students as long as they have the associated email, regardless of start or end date. 

#### Portfolio Auto-Generation Date

Students are commonly instructed to submit their portfolio with a "Learning Summary" when completing the unit. It is the portfolio that gets graded so if a student does not submit their portfolio they might not get a grade. If you want all portfolios to be created automatically so they can be graded, even if a student forgets to submit it, you can activate this auto-generated feature.
