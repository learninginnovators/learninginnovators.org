#### Code
Under "Code" the unit code assigned by the University is required. 

In Week O, when OnTrack connects with other university systems, students enrolled in the unit will be automatically enrolled into the unit in OnTrack through this code. 

Every night, student enrollments are updated so any changes in student enrolments will be reflected in OnTrack.

If more than a unit should share an OnTrack site, both codes should be included in this space using the following sample format: "DKN000/DKN999".

If you would like to enrol students before the system does it automatically, or unenrol students, for example if a unit code was incorrectly added and the wrong students have been automatically enroled, this can be done through the "Students" tab. Instructions on how to do this can be found in that section of this guide.

### Andrew If the cvs is updated will the system override this when it syncs with the system again?
