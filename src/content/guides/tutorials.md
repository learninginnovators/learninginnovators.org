## Tutorials

Here you create the tutorial groups to assign to the students for marking.

These tutorial groups can be used to assign a tutor a group of students and also specific tasks, or a group of students for specific tasks. Any combination, but there are a few steps.

1. Create a
### tutorial stream
and call it Assessment.

2. Add a
### tutorial 
by filling all boxes and then clicking "+".
   
     a. Under Abbreviation you can use anything, we recomment using either the name of the tutor or the task that this tutorial will be assigned to. This name must be unique, the system will not allow you to call two tutorials the same.
   
     b. Under Campus choose either the Campus that the students assigned to this tutorials are in. The system will not allow students in other Campus to be enrolled in this tutorial so if you don't want this restriction just choose "unspecified campus". This is very important!
   
     c. Under Location you can use any term you want.
   
     d. Under Day you can choose the day this tutorial runs if this is linked to a teaching tutorial or "Asynchronous" if it is just a marking group.
   ### ANDREW does this do something?
   
     e. Under Time you write the time this tutorial runs if this is linked to a teaching tutorial, you can also write N/A if there is no specific time this group meets.
   
     f. Under Tutor you will get a drop down with all the staff that have been added to the unit, tutors and convenors. If a tutor does not appear in the list it is because it has not been added under the "Staff" tab.
   
     g. Under Capacity you can choose to write a number if you want to limit the number of students a tutorial can be assigned to, or -1 if the number is unlimited. If assigning students to a tutorial through a csv (see Student section) you can override the number chosen under Capacity. This means you can add more students than the maximum capacity stated.
   
     h. CLICK "+" or your tutorial will not be saved in the system! This will also give you spaces to fill in info for a new tutorial if required.

   ### NOTE 
   that clicking on "New tutorial stream" is used to create a new group of tutorials. To create a new tutorial only, you just fill in the empty boxes under the tutorial stream you already have.

4. ### Assigning students
to marking tutorials can be done in different ways.

   a. If you have chosen under the "Unit Details" tab "synchronise timetable", any workshops or tutorials in Calista will apear here with the respective students enrolled.

   b. If you create the tutorials you want to have under an Assessment tutorial stream BEFORE the system enrols students (day 2 week 0), students will be automatically enrolled and distributed evenly across these tutorials.

   c. Students enrolled late need to be added to a tutorial by hand in the "Student" tab. We show you how to do this in the "Student" section.

   d. If you create the tutorials late or if you want a specific distribution of students or tasks you can enrol students using a csv under the "Student" tab. We show you how to do this in the "Student" section.

6. ### Assign the tutorial stream
you want to use for marking a task 
### to the specific task 
in "Task" tab under step (2).
   This is a common issue that we get contacted for, when tutors can't see their students but they have been correctly assigned to their tutorials it is because th wrong tutorial streamhas been assigned to that task!
