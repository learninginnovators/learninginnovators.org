If the name of the staff you need to add does not come up in the drop down list when typing, ask them to go to ontrack.deakin.edu.au. That will bring them into the list.

If you want someone to be able to make changes and access all the information in this unit choose "Convenor" role. 

If you only want to provide tutor access choose "Tutor".

Assign the Unit chair to the main convenor role by selecting the respective box.
