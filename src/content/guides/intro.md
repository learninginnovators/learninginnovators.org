## OnTrack

OnTrack is a web assessment tool. Originally created to support a task oriented approach to portfolio assessment, it can support many different types of assessment. 

OnTrack helps students achieve their learning outcomes by taking the focus away from grades and placing the importance on learning. Throughout a teaching period, students complete tasks to learn content, and develop skills and dispositions. OnTrack promotes engagement in feedback dialogues at a task level between students anf the teaching team.  Grades are not allocated to tasks during the course of learning, only at the end of the teaching period, when the full portfolio of tasks is submitted.
