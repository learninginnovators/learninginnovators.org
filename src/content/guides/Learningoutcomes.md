## Learning Outcomes

In this tab you can add the learning outcomes of your unit if you want students to reflect after submitting each task on how it aligns with these learning outcomes.

If you do not add learning outcomes here, students will submit each task without having to align and reflect towards these.

To add the learning outcomes you can either:

* on the bottom right corner select the icon "+Add Outcome" and you will get this screen where you can fill in the information of one learning outcome.
